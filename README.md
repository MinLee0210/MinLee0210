### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Minh, an AI Enthusiast. 

+ ðŸ”­ I am currently building an AI-agent for summarizing documents. My main focused is on short documents, for instance, a blog or a news. 
+ ðŸŒ± I am now working with **huggingface** due of its robustness in the natural language processing sector, particularly with the `transformers` library. 
+ âš¡ Programming, in my opinion, is about expressing movements in the outside world in the simplest, most logical manner possible. Programming is like playing music; we translate our own dreams into technology, enthralling users and inspiring them to sing harmoniously about the world's future.
